# EE551-Project
This is my repo for EE551 Python Project: Fantasy Football Analysis

# Source Code
The idea behind this project is to work on a weekly fantasy league. It uses the DraftKings API for player info and stats. This will sift through the previous weeks players, see which ones will play this week, and determining the best squad for the week based on last week's performance.
